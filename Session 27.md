We are in the cave away from the dragon near the ship. We discuss what to do with Haliloo's body.  We chose to we'd take the body back to our inn and call it either "The Headless Bard" or "The Bard's Head" - creating a story around the dead bard. Dayon slides the body into the bag of holding with some ice which he does well.

 Tinjong tells us the dragon is unlikely to find us as it normally goes west not east and that we need to ring a bell when we reach the whale. We realise the axe beaks behind and they are likely dead. We invite Tinjong to our in and give her a voucher for 1 free sushi. We then head east along the coast. 
 
We arrive near a pier with a frozen dock and boat. There is a small island near by where the bell is meant to be. As we get closer the wind seems to be more still and it's a bit colder. The water near by is all frozen.

Dayon tests the ice and it seems thick enough so he heads to the island. As he approaches he realises there is a patch of ice which is clearly newly frozen which he avoids. Ted and Sudo follow him after a while taking his guidance. Vauldrick stays behind. 

Circling underneath the ice is a skeleton of a whale. There is a post with a large bronze bell. Dayon waits for Ted and Sudo to catch up. Tehre are very faint etched blue ruins on the bell and on the land we are standing on.  Ted and Dayon tries to read it, Dayon reads the "Deep knows the cold, the cold knows the sky, the sky knows the deep. Give of all three and the slumbering will wake." and Ted reads nothing. 

Valudrik goes to check a near by house but the ice is so coated on he can't open the door. He goes to look for a window but he sees a window at the other end to which he looks in. It looks empty on the inside - its covered in ice. Ted reads the old log book which mentions a whale the can move through the ice but does not mention how to communicate with it.

Dayon takes out a pickaxe and, enhancing the sound with thaumatergy, hits the bell. It rings in a very muted faction. The ruins grow brighter. Dayon notices that ruins are split in three sections. He tries to figure out what each section would do. Dayon, rings it again, and Ted keeps an eye on it. He notices the top one bairly lights up, second slighty, and third alot. Ted realises that the first one is water, second is ice, third is sky.

Ted grabs his tea mug, fills it with water and ice, holding it up near the bell. Ted asks Dayon to do the honours but before I notices a humanoid near by. Dayon follows through and hits the bell and nothing changes.

It is actually a goliath statue. Ted starts to ritual cast dectect magic. Dayon tries to crack the ice with his pick but there is no way through, he keeps going through but he's not making any headway. Ted detects lots of magic on the from the bell, a bit from the head of the whale, and a very slight amount from the statue. 

Dayon drops some ice on the third or ruin circle for ice and the ruins glow a lot brighter. It sounds like a bell is rung and a cracking sound. Cracks of ice start to move at the base of feet of the goliath. The goliath yells "Get away.". A piecering wail comes through the sky. Something swooshes past us and around near the bell. It is a banshee; her hair is matted, tangled in a fisherman's net. She looks sad and mournful. Ted sees a hand crawl up from under the cliff with a clacity sound. We've awoken the goliath but something else has awoken underneath it.

We cut from the would be chaos and Haliloo takes a step forward.... and another. He looks like he did on the ship. In front of him is a golden gate with fancy intracet details which swings open as he approaches. Beyond is green rolling fields. He takes a step forward but his nose hits an invisible barrier. It doesn't hurt. He says "Hello and tries to talk to the field.". He walks forward again but still makes no progress. He feels like a song might work, and goes to grab his bag pipe, and plays a song. He pours every ounce of his soul into a song, it's divine - literally, he's never played so well in his life. The barrier shimmers and becomes transparent. He sees the souls there and their joy. He sees the truth of this place. He realises he's dead. He realises his joy has always required some effort. The music softens then a woman, her hair long, in non-form fitting, comes forward. He recognises this is lyra. He stops playing. She says "You wore a mask of joy." "Yes, I'm a bard. I play a part.". She has a sad smile, "You hid the scars of war. They never healed. It was just to conceil a vicious screak in you. Your performance was flawless and is flawless but it was just a performance." "So, I've been faithful. I've done my prayers. I've performed in your name. I should have a place." She sighs, and her expersion shifts to a bit of pity. "You still do not see. You are still performing." She steps back. "I'm so sorry, you are found wanting." "You can't do this to me." She turns and walks away and Haliloo says"Lillia no!"  She says, "You were never for this place." Haliloo drops to his knees as the gates shut. The world turns to grey. He tries to hold on to this memory. He holds on to a single perfect shared of this memory carrying the divine notes of what he played, the sent of a rose in sunlight, laughter, a divine spark of light, in the coming darkness, and around him becomes dark. he is utterly and completely alone. He holds on to the shard of joy. He starts walking and sees something walks passed him with a blank stare. They don't notice him. He keeps walking. He feels not need to eat or drink. He knows at some point at some point to stop and rest. He does this on a cycle. Hours turn into days. He keeps walking. He eventually reaches a building with 4 stone walls with no roof. Someone is putting a brick on to it one at at time then moving on to another wall, then as he finishes the wall crumbles. "Am I in hell?" the memory he is holding on to starts to fade. The days turn to weeks. The weeks grow into months. The months become a year.

Back to reality, the claws are coming out of the cliff, it's movements are very stop start. Combat starts. The galvin magin flies over towards Dayon and attacks Dayon zapping him with touching him with both hands. *Battle report ends * We noticed the veins are blackened with lots of little shards and it is clearly shardaline. *Battle continues*

We cut back to Haliloo. He sees a variety of humaniods and none humanoids. <It's like the place inbetween in the good places>. He ends the year with his hope fading.

Back in the combat. Dayon kills the Galvin Malvar which goes up in fire and sparks and shards. Ted's spirit guardian's slashes through the banshee - killing it. The goliath warrior screams a mournful wail. The ruins light up and it makes it incredibly bright. The bell sounds get's louder and louder and louder.

Back to Haliloo. He manages to find a way to lift himself up. It has been 10 years.  He hasn't made a sound in over 5 years. He keeps the same cycle of sleep, wake up. He doesn't know exactly how long but feels it's been 10 years about. The first thing he hears is the sound of a bell, ring through. Then he sees some snow flakes. It's cold. It's colder than he's ever known. He walks towards it. The bell disappears. It's still snowing and cold. He takes a step what feels to be a barrier, like the barrier to the world of joy. It's just a cold expanse. He knows he's walked through something but it's a grey expanse of nothingness. The ground is gravellyish and he can feel it. He drops to the ground and plays with the cold gravel. There is no sky. He's so happy to feel something. He realises its not gravel but shards of ice. He can feel a presence. "Hello...." Haliloo says. The voice that responds is not 1 voice but 3. He hears it very clearly, one sounds like an old crone, one sounds very commanding and clear (like royaltiy), and the third one is a very sharp tone (like the evil queen from snow white) - they are speaking at the same time. The old crone whispers "that little dancing god. She offers a brief party and calls it eternety." The cruel voice says "She's a child's candy, and I am a dark eternal night." The commanding queen's voice says "She who sings of fleeting joy has abandoned you." in a mocking tone. In front of Haliloo he sees what looks to be a giant owl with a cloak around her. The old crone says, she saw the cold in your soul and called it a flaw. The giant owl woman diasappers and in it's place a glowing ice shard appears. The sharp cruel tone says "I see it as a weapon." The regal turns  into an ice creature, and says "She saw your scars and saw them a burden." All the show at the same time. "I call them armour." It rapidly switches between the 3. The old cron says, "You were already a creature of winter." The commanding vote, "You died in my domain. Your soul is my property. I willl not see it fade or burried in a pub. I will find you." "I will grant you purpose", they all say. He quotes the first verse of the Rime of the Frostmaiden voice to her. "You dare mock us! You rime! You mock us." He sinks into the ground and it is cold. He is there for weeks.

Back to reality. Coming up from the hole which was shattered from the thinner ice, is the head of a very much alive narwhal. Ted looks behind to my right, and the Goliath has now returned to ice. The whale can speak telepathically. 

Ted asks his name and we find out his master was called "Anga" is the whale's name "Anga Juk". The skeleton has not disappeared. Dayon asks if he is a powerful whale who can help us. He supposes he can help us and is powerful. We introduce ourselves. We ask if he can take us to Ythrin. "I think you may have been mistaken. I do not know this Ythrin. I thought you'd know about me. I can take you through the water." "Quick team huddle" - Ted calls. Dayon asks if he knows a place where we can revive a fallen party member and the answer was no. Ted asks what the deal of this relationship will be. "Company, I like the loudness of the world. I like finding new places, albiet in bodies of water." 

Haliloo opens is eyes and he's back out of the ice gravel. The owl form stands over him. She goes open your eyes, which he does. This is a place of erosion. He sees rocks and terrain crumbling as he watches. The ground falls from his hand. The crone's voice says "Look at him, so breakable." He keeps quiet. "You, have friends. You had friends." "They were so warm. They will shatter. And they will die. And their fleeting warmth will be forgotten." The cruel voice, "Unless one of them has the strength to endure." The commanding one says. "Unless one can guide them through my cold." They all say, "Serve me, rise as my champion. Be the beautiful final cold that end all fleeting warmth." He kneels and swears to them. "The song of joy is over the hymn of winter begins." A swirl of ice and snow and frost. He is cold, the coldest he's ever been. He's so cold he can't even shiver. She says to Haliloo, it's no longer 3 voices, it's the commanding one. "My winter is an eternal shroud to hide a city that must never wake. Wizards from They, digging like maggots into the ice. Seeking my power. My city." She disappears and a vision of the shattered ruins of what was once a floating tower. "They've already found one of their outposts, this lost spire. They are looking for keys to the floating city. This cannot happen." The vision changes again. He sees a large hulking fortress in the mountains, he's never seen this before. "The dwarves in the mountain. I whispered to the deepest of hells and he masqueraded as one of their gods. In truth this is all my design. They will some some chaos. That is my plan. Once done their usefulness is at their end."  "Retrieve the shardelen once the dwarves soe their chaos." Something attaches to his face. "You mask it so well and you will need that to be my agent. When you find Ythin and you guard it for centuries to come. You will be the grim truth of my winter. You are no longer her's you are mine. My Illeric."

Back at the whale. Ted asks if he has a deck and some rooms. Anga Juk says "Of course." and lowers himself so we can see that there is a ship moored onto him, it's quite comfy. It can easily fit half a dozen people, maybe more. Ted climbs on. Dayon follows. Vauldrick leaves a message by the bell in mold earth to let people know how to solve the puzzle in the future. Vauldrick gets on. It then sinks and the water does not touch us as there is a bubble protecting us. It is cold. Ted asks if we can attack through the bubble. "My master anga tried that once and it popped the bubble." We see other whales and sharks outside the bubble. "Ah this is my favourite spot" we see. a coral reef with bubbles coming out. It's really peaceful. Then Valdrick sees a squid past and he sees someone with a mask standing behind on the deck with us. "No." says Valdrick. "Not doing it. Ted!" It's wearing a face of sadness porcelain white, and icey blue cloak, he's holding an ice rapier. We notice the armour that he's wearing looks like plate but it's actually ice. He just stands there.

Ted offers his hand and the person shakes it. It says "Hello Ted." Dayon opens the bag of holding and the corpse is still in there but encased in ice. We think he's a ghost of Haliloo.  

"Illarick Fallowmere" He removes his mask and he has icy veins on his face. He looks like Haliloo but more gaunt. His bright red hair is now a pale auburn. We chat to him to work things out. Valdrick get's to see his memories from his death. Dayon and Ted short rest.
