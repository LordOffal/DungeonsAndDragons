- Opening:
	- We see a house on a tree (15/16ft tall) with mny faces & limbs. Doesn't seem to be moving / active
	- Surrounded by bushes, not normal bushes. They move & look to be small 5 limbed creatures.
	- Hunched back, late 80s old human lady with fey hair puffy cheecks. Looks like my average grandmother.
- All the wood of the bush seems to be all the same
- Failed at catching a shrub (on a 19)
- Shrubs are old lady's friend
- Inside lady's house:
	- She is a hoarder
	- A painting above fire of a sexy as elven lady on a throne. All around her is people worshiping her.
	- We can't place this lady
	- Was a queen of the old lday
	- She seems to have been around before the gardener
	- "Granny Green" - old lady's name
	- "Gardnerner's wood was more than my life time" - Granny Green
	- Kenkar made a bet on naming every weapon in the hut
		- He failed
- I thought the "Kemonke" was a shuriken
- Granny Green is always here
--------------------------------------------------------------
- Me Only:
	- I know the world before was higher tech
	- I know because I met a creature / object called P.O.E.T
	- He's an automaton
	- He's designed to observe the universe
	- I would know the event called the calamety rapidly changed the contitinent
	- This would have happened thousands of years (min 400/500 years)
	- P.O.E.T. told me a civ "The Authority" the glitched on saying it
--------------------------------------------------------------
- Katia asked if we can slay the gardener
- Granny Green told us of a ritual to seal his powers
- I know several spells (heard tale of) could force one to be able to speak I mental block
- She got it from the mountains nearby with some monks
	- East of us
- Monastery to the north too
- Drough as a race didn't exist during Granny Green's time
	- Dark elves didn't exist in her time
- Spine is named by Dwarves after their god's body
	- Dwarves didn't like humans due to their spread
- I asked a secret question and she got upset and said no
	- Asking someone if they are an automata is rude + illegal
- Granny Green told me
	- "Go to the highest point on the spine the northern peak. I will find a building and I should be able to see my patreon." (Unsure if southern but most likely northern)
- The Auralean Authority -> Elven Kingdom. Have settlements through out this land
- Go to capitals of elves (one in the west) -> 2 weeks travel near the coast (old) other north of the spine near eastern side of neck. That is their spiritual capital. Seen as a capital by many.
- Me Thought - authority made automita but not guaranteed
- We gave 5 drops of blood (one being Malking's) to bind the Gardener
- Gained a Crossbow (light) of Sapping Sting from Granny Green
	- Magical wepaon - Normally light crossbow that grants the ability to use cantrip Sapping Sting
- Saw a shimer on the route hom from the Gardenner's wood
	- I would associate it with magic made physical
	- My master told me
	- I don't know why it had a dropping effect
- Tananbough has gone under a lot of reconstruction since we left
- Time we felt we spent on the quest is less than reality
- Station is full repaired
------------------------------------------------------------
|Side thought|
So a high tech society has colapsed before and we have a group trying to destroy tech now. Patreon my be linked to previou calamity

------------------------------------------------------------
- Katia need to go to Studgate -> As told bt Jerick
- Katia punches Malkin when she finds out about his crimes
- Malking runs and a combat occurs
- We lost him in a crowd
