28th Uktar - evening

We are walking carefully down the narrow corridor, some of us have to stoop low. We eventually reach the end; the path way cuts out and drops down to still water (and the tunnel continues on to a stone wall). In front of us is a stone wall with a leaver by the water. 

We discuss lightly what to do and Haliloo pulls the lever while we are discussing it. The lever is very rusty and it doesn't move. I walk over and cast mend while he's still pushing and Haliloo keeps adding more force which then causes him to easily push it down and fall to the ground.

The walls then shifted up showing more water down the corridor and no path to walk on. We discuss what to do. Vauldrik then looked at the water to work out the depth and initially he struggled to see the bottom but then he saw something in the water which looks humanoid. It's clearly hitting the bottom so the water can't be more than 6ft-10ft. 

We discuss what to do after look around. Haliloo stabs the water, thinking it might be a slime, bu it does not react. We ask Sudo if he's willing to dip his toe in and Haliloo goes to push him in but slips and fails so styles it off.

I move into the water and swim effortlessly, taking sudo and reggie with me to the nearest alcove. In the room are 5 people who look like they are starving (5 humans), they hide away. The man at the front looks 60. They say there are servants of the speaker. They mention that they were trapped by the cultists and that they were put on the. I give food to help them out. We have a discussion on whether or not to save them by shouting loudly. Haliloo doesn't trust they aren't cultists so asks me to insult Levistus. To which I do. They heard the plan though and don't react. 

We tell them they can swim to safety. We have a discussion on what the state of the town is and our answers are honestly quite psychopathic. They swim to saftey and we help them out of the water, dry them off, and Dayon gives them more food. The elderly man draws out a map of all the underground paths.

I get back in the water and start swimming to the locked door. Vauldrik tries to use mold earth to give him hand holds one at a time painfully. He struggles and slips but saves himself. I swim gracefully past. The locked door as a blue stone slab.  We look for for a lever but find nothing. After some persuasion I stick my head in the water to see how deep the wall goes; it goes 3ft down from there there are metal bars.

I knock on the stone and it seems super dense. Vauldrick and I dive underwater and teleports us to the otherside. As soon as we lift our heads up on the water there are swords pointed at us.

COMBAT STARTS

Vauldrik looks around and sees nothing of note to help us. He teleports on to the near by boat, away from the swords, then casts mind sliver on both of them. I then look around and see sweet nothing. Then I command the sword cultists to Halt which freezes them in place which succeeds and they freeze. I then climbed out of the water.

On the otherside of the door Haliloo leaps to a hand-hold and monkeys himself, swinging across, the walls down the corridor - landing gracefully. He looked for a button or switch to open the door but found nothing

_notes of combat stopped here_

We win easily. We make jokes about how Haliloo and Dayon being useless in the fight. Then we go to the side room and see a frozen block with what looks to be a wooden (fake) effegy to Levisitus in it (looks like a human in it). Haliloo starts ritual casting detect magic and I guard him. Dayon and Vauldrik go in the left room and see the lever for the door (which Haliloo opened with Knock in the fight). I then go back to look at the effegy and notice it's a stark resemblance to a human - clearly made with care. it's start  Then then check the right room and very different - nothing crazy just furnished. There is a chair, desk, leather bound book, and a familar black raven. The raven is pearched on one of the horns of a woman sitting at the desk. She tells them to get out. They notice a staff in easy reach to her that has a blue top part (looks icy) but she isn't wearing the cultist robes. She has white hair on the back with horns. She has a fur lined tight leather clothes. She's clearly reading from a spell book. Dayon asks why her Raven was looking at us. She says - "Those idiots were meant to deal with you." Then tells us to leave and goes back to reading her book.

I go through to them leaving Reggie on guard. We chat with her trying to get info on what she;s being studying. At that time Haliloo finishes casting his Identify and notices that there is nothing magic about it but it is a very real effigy. Dayon asks her for what she's been studying, and after a lengthy pause she says "She's looking for a something lost. I'm looking for the lost netherese city Ythyn". She mentions the cultists group name is "The Night of the Black swords". Her name is tieflings. Haliloo and Ted basically have a break down hearing her logic for helping the cultists.

Dayon suggests her helping us and I get irate and am rude to her. She tells me to leave and I walk out of the room. She asks us why we are here and Haliloo answers her with our shpeel. Haliloo also eventually gets frustrated and leaves. Dayon wants her to live and Haliloo feels apathetic. Ted and Vauldric wants to kill her. She wants to work for Levistus as she saved her life though she doesn't work for him as a cultist. 

She tries touches Vauldric and he tries to mind rape her but fails miserably. We leave her alone and Haliloo and I use sacred flame and smash the effigey to destruction. We break it completely, burn it to ashes and destroy the ashes.
