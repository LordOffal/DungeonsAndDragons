We've been riding for days from caer dineval on our axe beaks which we regained. Before us, 100ft approx, lies our destination "Dark Dutchess" a ship wreck on the edge of the Sea of Moving Ice. It has a wooden hull which is frozen in place. The date is the 30th Ucktar. It is cold, it almost feels personal. 

Ted passes around the fliers we recieved from Caer Dineval to remind the group why we are here - which is because there were weird celestial sightings and there should be treasure. 

Dayon looks for tracks but finds none. As we approach and are about 15 ft away we here some gutteral roars and gargles. The ship is clearly titled so it'll be hard to get a strong footing. We approach the lowest side but pause. Haliloo starts ritual casting comprehend languages and I keep him company while Vauldrick and Dayon walk around the ships.

Dayon sees some movement in the water in the distance which would be a group of seals. Dayon and Vauldrick gossip about Ted being weird. Vauldrick seems to be pushing that Ted is odd which Dayon is not 100% buying it. They then move on to Haliloo and call him "just crazy" (Vauldrick does). Vauldrick tries to show off to Dayon and make ice out of snow thinking that snow turns into glass but in the end just started burning his hands and a puddle of water. He then turns those disks of water into ice.

Dayon then tries to show Vauldrick how to skim rocks using them. Dayon throws and it skips so far that it disappears into the fog. Vauldrick copies but does a 3 skimmer throw which is very good for a first timer. They keep going for a few minutes. 

Ted while this is happening is going over action plans with Sudo and Reggie. Haliloo and the gang then rejoin the others. We then climb up, Vauldrick helped Ted up and he loudly got to the top but did it easily enough. Then Ted helped Vauldrick up who got up slightly quieter. Vauldrick leaped up easily. Haliloo throws some rope up and we tie it so he can use it to climn up.

There is a massive hole in the ship. We get excited about potentially making this a sister hotel to our tavern. We then see claw marks in the ship. Ted grabs a rock, casts light on it, then drops it down the hole to see. Ted can see some greyish whitish fur when I drop it down on the bottom floor of the boat and Ted hear sa growl. Haliloo does not understand it as it seems more like a noise of surprise. Ted realises that the claw marks that they came from a dragon!!!! Ted shares the info and Dayon casts cast without trace.

Dayon walks to the front of the ship and works out that a dragon had landed on the front of the ship. Haliloo looks into the sky to see if there is a dragon but does not see or hear one despite giving it a really good look. Vauldrick also looks down the hole. Ted casts aid on Vauldrick, himself, and Dayon.

Vauldrick tries to throw Reggie down the hole and the both have to work really hard but Reggie gets away. This caused a lot of noise. Reggie then hides behind Ted. While Ted and Vauldrick argue Haliloo walks downstairs. We then join him. Valudrick goes to the edge of the otherside of the ship, goes into the side room and see nothing of note (seems like it was a medical room). Valdrick then goes in another room. In the other room there is a couple of maps (one of the Sword coast and one of Icewind dale), Vauldrick leaves them. Dayon finds some navigators tools as well as a healers kit, 3 vials of anti-toxin, and a vial of holy water (which he keeps quiet for now). In the final room at the front of the ship Vauldrick and Dayon go in and see a room for lots of non-perishable goods. Kia defrosts a barrel and give Dayon a lot of basic useful items.

Ted and Haliloo go in the big room at the rear of the ship. It's a big room and there is a human corpse in the middle. He is wearing a pirates hat and he is holding a leather journal. Ted takes the journal and starts reading it. Haliloo casts speaks with dead. He asks him if he is Captain Rudolf Bluemoon and the corpse responds yes. Then he asks how he met his end; Rudolf responds "Food, need food.". Then he asks, "Did you find the netherese outpost" and he says "no".

Ted notices on his hat that there is a red eel wrapped around a gold trident which is one of the seals of one of the pirate factions of the city of luskam. Each faction is known a ship. This is from the ship Souljack.

Haliloo asks where the star chart is and gets a response of "It is lost.". Haliloo asks where the netherese outpost is? "We believed east of here.".  Haliloo then asked "How far east?" and he responds "Hundreds of miles.". Haliloo then takes the chest from the cold dead mans arms. It's frozen so Kia unfreezes it, this takes 10 minutes. Ted looks around the room for more stuff and finds the key to the chest, wine bottles which are emtpy, and nothing. Ted takes the hat from the corpse and wears it. He ritual casts detect magic on it.

While waiting Haliloo hears the words "Hungry" and hears a step. It's in giant. "Come out come out." We hid and it passed us onto the main deck. Haliloo & Dayon hears "I know your hear. I know they are here. Hungry. I'm hungry." Haliloo interupts Ted's detect magic to make him stealth. Vauldrick looks out of the key hole and see it's an ice troll. Ted knows they are only found in cold places, aren't intellegent, and have strong natural armour.

We then jump the troll and combat starts. <FIGHTING HAPPENS> We bully the poor troll as it is a fairly easy fight with Dayon taking some light damage. Dayon stabs it with his flaming sword killing it.

As it dies it falls to it's knees and says "I was just.... hungry... for the kobolds below." (Miseed part where it said saying wanting to eat dragon meat).

Ted restarts his ritual cast of detect magic. They open the chest which is split in two; one half has a load of corks from wine bottles; the other side is filled with gold. Dayon finds a bunch of stuff in there (in there is 150gp) plus more. Detect magic goes off and the hat is not magic however what does show up as magical is the fuzzy grey bag. The school of magic for the bag is unknown.

Ted experiments with the bag but nothing seems to trigger it. Haliloo puts his hand in and pulls out a fuzzy ball then puts it back. I then throw the fuzzy ball and it grows into a panther which pounds right towards me and starts licking me. 

<I need the panther stat sheet>.

Dayon talks to it and talks to him. He says "Ted is my friend. From the bag." Dayon tells him that he is my friend. So the Panther says he is his friend too. He says he smells something bad and bounds downstairs. We all follow. And Ted hears it's definitely Kobolds. Haliloo and Dayon talk to the Kobolds. Dayon tells them how he killed the Troll. Haliloo threats to let the Panther "Bagheera" - named by Ted, in the room. The Kobolds let on the bottom of the ship is covered in gold and all the snow mounds have gold underneath them. In there we can see a frozen Crag Cat. They say they don't have a leader but they like the dragon called "Arveiaturace" .

We start melting the ice using Ted's flaming sphere and Kia's flame but after an hour and it starts to melt. The Kobolds get antsy and are worried about us stealing the treasure but Haliloo calms them down a bit. Going through the first layer 72gp 182sp 352cp and 2 pearls intact (quite nice) ~100gp. We keep going but now using tools and it only takes an hour which yeilds some art objects like statues - we find 9 tattered pieces of indago fabric, 3 pieces of quartz, a single aquamarine cracked down the centre, a scrimshaw figuren of an archer etch with runic script. 

<Side retrospective item Dayon checked the other room and finds a goat in the same uniform as the kobolds tied in.>

The dragon was arrives. The ship creeks with it landing on it and the air gets cold. "I smell warm flesh and here the panic of beating hearts. Ready your spells Melthrand we have uninvited guests." We see there is a figure on the back of the dragon which looks humanoid. It looks ancient.
