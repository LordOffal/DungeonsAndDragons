**Physical description (including clothing):**  
### **Form:**

Kanetama stands the height of a wolfhound, shaped like a fox made from memory and machine. He is not made of **flesh**—he is **formed**, wrought by smiths long dead and spells still echoing through his joints. The lines of his body are sharp, layered, jointed—like overlapping plates of shrine armor—yet his movements are smooth and feline. His presence is **weighty**, not for his mass, but for the _gravity of intention_. When he is still, the world hushes with him.

---

### **Metal Hide:**

His body is constructed of **wrought iron** and **aged bronze**, mottled with time—**patina** paints the edges of his shoulder plates and along the spine of his tails. His frame bears **visible rivets**, exposed pistons, and faint seams etched with **kanji glyphs** that shimmer when he shifts. Every plate is **sculpted**, not stamped—like the result of **a century-long prayer hammered into steel.** Beneath the joints, blue and gold **arcane filaments pulse**, breathing light into his every step.

---

### **Faceplate:**

His face is an elegant mask of brushed silver, stylized like a ceremonial kitsune visage—**neither smiling nor snarling**, only watching. Its eyes are narrow slits of soft amber light that **glow from within**, never blinking. Sometimes, when you're alone with him, the glow seems to soften… as though he **recognizes you** not as creator, but as _bondmate._

---

### **Tails:**

He bears **six mechanical tails**, long and serpentine—**sculpted to mimic the bristle and flow of real fur**, but clearly segmented, with fine gaps between moving pieces. Along their length, faint runework pulses like a **heartbeat**—each tail gently glows along its spine in lines of **soft golden light**, with intermittent sparks of deep blue energy flowing like **foxfire** from tailtip to base. When he is calm, the tails sway with grace. When threatened, they lift like banners behind him, charged and ready.

---

### **Sound & Movement:**

His footfalls are **soft**, surprisingly so—each step leaves a brief shimmer of **gold light on the ground**, which fades like incense smoke. His internal gears are **quiet**, almost respectful. Only in tense moments do they **whine softly**, the way a shrine door might creak open after a hundred years of silence.

---

### **Voice:**

Kanetama does not speak. But when he _communicates_, it is through a hum—a resonance in your mind like **a prayer bell struck in a windless room**. He expresses intent, never words. Approval feels like warm metal against your palm. Discontent like the smell of hot iron. He watches more than he warns… unless you are in danger. Then, he _moves faster than sound itself._

|Trait|Measurement|Description|
|---|---|---|
|**Height (shoulder)**|**93 cm**|Just under 1 meter tall—similar to a large wolfhound, with proud upright posture and a slight arch to his back like a cat mid-step.|
|**Body Length (nose to flank)**|**1.3 m**|His body is compact but elongated—flexible and built for stealth, movement, and grace, despite its solid metal composition.|
|**Tail Length (each)**|**0.9 m**|Each tail is nearly a meter long when fully extended. They can curl, balance, strike, or radiate energy through complex movement patterns.|
|**Weight (manifested)**|**136 kg**|Dense and forged. He feels **anchored** when touched—but moves as if weightless when active.|
|**Eye Diameter (glow core)**|**6.8 cm**|The "eyes" emit soft amber light like **dormant lanterns**, and grow brighter with tension, battle-readiness, or alertness.|
|**Material Composition**|—|Primarily **wrought iron**, **bronze filigree**, and inner **magical lattice**, reinforced with **runework welds** that glow under stress.|

### **Mystic & Mechanical Traits**

- **Sanctified Core**: His heart is not a furnace, but a **prayer orb** etched with runes of binding and protection. It glows when he defends you.
    
- **Shrineforged**: Kanetama radiates a presence like **a god’s statue half-awake**. Beasts hesitate before him. Spirits recognize him.
    
- **Runetail Signaling**: His tails can **flare symbols mid-combat**—from warnings to sigils of misdirection. They are silent messages to those who understand.
    
- **Lightbound Limbs**: When damaged, his joints emit pulses of protective light, knitting his own limbs for a time before failing completely.
    
- **Torii-Walker**: In moments of peace, Kanetama walks like he’s always **returning home through a misted shrine gate**, even in the deepest dark.
