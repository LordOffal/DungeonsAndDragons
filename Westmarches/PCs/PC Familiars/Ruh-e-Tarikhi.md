**Physical description (including clothing):**  
**Form:**  
Rutar is tall and statuesque, nearly the size of a great horned owl, yet his proportions are subtly off in ways the eye can never quite catch. He is not bound by nature—his frame flickers at the edges, like a candle seen through a thick veil of smoke. He is not a being of _flesh,_ but one of _form_—perpetually precise, always complete, yet somehow intangible.

**Feathers:**  
His feathers are impossibly dark—_not black,_ but **void-dark**, absorbing light like velvet over obsidian. When he moves, faint patterns shimmer across them, like ancient runes traced in ash. Some say they form words. Others say they spell memories. Only you can ever read them.

**Eyes:**  
Twin opals of luminous dusk—no pupils, no whites, just swirls of violet, grey, and flickering silver. They do not reflect—they _consume_ the world, quietly recording it. To look into his eyes is to remember something you never lived.

**Beak & Talons:**  
Polished ivory with a faint, iridescent sheen—as if carved from moonstone and smoothed by centuries of wind. His talons leave no wounds; they mark instead with frost or phantom chill, a warning not to the body, but to the soul.

**Voice:**  
He rarely speaks, even telepathically. But when he does, it is like **wind through stone corridors**, reverent and vast, carried as if it’s been echoing for centuries just to reach you.

| Trait                          | Measurement | Description                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------ | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Height (standing upright)**  | **82 cm**   | Just over 80cm tall—taller than most real-world owls, with a powerful, almost humanoid posture when at rest. He looms.                                                               |
| **Body Length (head to tail)** | **76 cm**   | His sleek, elongated frame suggests grace more than bulk—a streamlined silhouette built for silence.                                                                                 |
| **Wingspan**                   | **178 cm**  | Nearly **1.8 metres**—his wings are enormous when unfurled, like a cloak of velvet night stretching wall to wall. They rarely flap; they simply _glide_.                             |
| **Weight (true form)**         | **0 kg**    | He has _no true mass_—he is incorporeal unless he wills otherwise. But when bound into physical reality, his **manifested weight is approx. 3.6 kg**, like a dense hush in the room. |
| **Eye Diameter**               | **7.5 cm**  | Large, unblinking, and luminous—his eyes are unsettlingly expressive and seem _too intelligent_ for a mere beast.                                                                    |
| **Talon Length**               | **11.5 cm** | Long and elegant, like carved ivory hooks—not meant for maiming, but for _marking_. They leave spiritual traces, not blood.                                                          |

**Otherworldly Traits:**

- **Shadow-bound:** His body casts no shadow—but shadows _reach_ toward him.
    
- **Nightburn Markings:** Under moonlight, faint markings of silver fire bloom along his wings, like ancient constellations shifting across his form.
    
- **Wings of Smoke:** When he flies, the feathers at his wingtips sometimes unravel into tendrils of dark mist, curling like incense trails behind him.
