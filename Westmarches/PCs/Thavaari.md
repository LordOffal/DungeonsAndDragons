Story so far: 

[[Session 1]] _I’m writing this because [[Kojiki Juun|Koji]] said it helps you remember, and [[Xerxes Azhdaha|Xerxes]] said it makes people respect you more if you keep track of your victories._

We were walking to a town called **[[Dirthfell]]**. I don’t know why it’s called that. Maybe the dirt fell from somewhere. I’ll ask someone. Anyway, I was with **[[Noctus Minstryxson|Noctus]]**, **[[Kojiki Juun|Koji]]**, and **[[Xerxes Azhdaha|Xerxes]]**. We’re helping some people get to the town. There’s **[[Rionna]]** — she’s a cat lady and she drives the cart. She really likes coins. And **[[Tolly]]** is a farmer. He walks beside the cart. He looks tired all the time.

They all played Dragon Chess. It’s a game with tiny people and towers. I didn’t play. It’s boring and you can’t break anything. [[Kojiki Juun|Koji]] got upset about the bishops. [[Noctus Minstryxson|Noctus]] won. I think [[Xerxes Azhdaha|Xerxes]] came second. He looked like he wanted to win, but he didn’t get mad. I like when people don’t get mad.

After three days, we saw a barn on fire. Fire’s bad. It eats everything. I wanted to go stop it, but [[Kojiki Juun|Koji]] said there were [[Goblin dude|goblins]]. I don’t like [[Goblin dude|goblins]]. They squeal too much.

[[Kojiki Juun|Koji]] vanished into darkness and punched one. That was good. Then their [[Goblin Leader|leader]] tried to hit [[Xerxes Azhdaha|Xerxes]] and just kept... missing. I don’t know why he didn’t stop. It was embarrassing.

Then my rage came up. I couldn’t stop it. My eyes and tattoos started glowing green. Even my veins glowed. It felt good. I charged and hit the [[goblin leader]] hard.

[[Xerxes Azhdaha|Xerxes]] breathed fire at them. Actual fire — but his kind. Not the bad kind. It was helpful fire. He can do that because of his dragon blood. It looks cool and it smells like burning leather.

One goblin jumped off a boar and tried to grab a toad from the wagon. He slipped and landed on his face. I laughed. Another tried to hit [[Tolly]] but missed. That’s lucky. [[Tolly]] isn’t built for hitting things.

One did hit me. That made me angrier. I don’t remember much after that, except that **[[Noctus Minstryxson|Noctus]]** killed the one who fell over. He always aims right.

[[Xerxes Azhdaha|Xerxes]]’ owl flew by, flapping in front of a goblin, and I took that as a sign. I slashed the goblin down with a green flash of acid. Then I hit the leader again. I think I broke something important inside him.

[[Xerxes Azhdaha|Xerxes]] burned the rest again. His fire almost finished it. One of the boars tried to run, but I caught it and cut it clean across the neck. [[Noctus Minstryxson|Noctus]] caught another goblin trying to run. [[Kojiki Juun|Koji]] chased one too. [[Xerxes Azhdaha|Xerxes]] hit another boar with fire but didn’t kill it — so I did.

Then it was quiet. The fight was over.

We took the meat and the fur from the boars. [[Kojiki Juun|Koji]] or someone said we found six gold. I didn’t care about that. Meat’s more useful.

At the burning barn, there were two people — a half-orc lady and a human man. She looked strong. Her name was **[[Helga]]**. She smelled like plants. I think she’s a herbalist. The man was **[[Kev]]**. He looked nervous and soft, like a deer during thunder.

[[Kojiki Juun|Koji]] talked to them. He invited them to come to **[[Pyre]]** with us. I didn’t like that. Their barn was on fire. They should’ve been trying to stop it, not asking for help. I told them that. But [[Helga]] said it was too far gone. I guess she’s right.

[[Xerxes Azhdaha|Xerxes]] said they could get a house discount in [[Pyre]] if they used his name. That was kind of him. He’s always polite to me. I trust him. He’s clever, and I think he means well — at least to me. That’s enough.

[[Kev]] didn’t say much. He just looked scared and stuck close to Helga.

We kept walking and made it to **[[Dirthfell]]**. It’s small, with wooden buildings and not many people. [[Rionna]] wanted to visit the inn, so we followed her. It’s called **[[The Wilting Tulip]]**, which is a weird name. Flowers aren’t supposed to wilt in inns.

Inside, the bartender was a big man named **[[Daryl]]**. He looked like he could carry a barrel in one hand. [[Noctus Minstryxson|Noctus]] asked about Wilbur — that’s who we’re supposed to meet — but [[Rionna]] found a note saying he’d be a day late.

[[Noctus Minstryxson|Noctus]] paid for Helga and Kev to have a room. That was nice. He’s always trying to help people. Even people he doesn’t know. I think that’s what paladins do.

[[Xerxes Azhdaha|Xerxes]] bought himself and me a room. He also convinced the bartender to give us free beer if we carried barrels down. He said we had to carry two each. I carried three. He looked impressed. I thought he might be flirting, but I couldn’t tell. I told him no thanks just in case. He didn’t seem offended.

The beer tasted fine. I wanted to test if I could use the mug as a weapon, but I ended up spilling it on [[Noctus Minstryxson|Noctus]]. He didn’t yell. That was good. It was a bit funny.

That night, there were lanterns on a hill with a tree. It was peaceful. [[Kojiki Juun|Koji]] tried to make tremors for [[Noctus Minstryxson|Noctus]] to help him “see.” I don’t really get how that works, but Koji said it might help.

An older man came to talk to us. His name was **[[Ewald]]**. He’s the innkeeper. He looked like someone who used to fight but doesn’t anymore. He told us about a brawling contest. We signed up as a team of four. I asked if I could use mugs as weapons. He said there would be tools, so I think that means yes.
