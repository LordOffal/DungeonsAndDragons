**Description**:

Background: Xerxes came with his Mother, and siblings to [[Pyre]] with the initial set up on being ordered by the main branch of the family. The small number of Dark Elves (Drow) wanted to make sure they maintained a presence in any endeavours the Empire and it's citizen take part in. Our family was sent out to gain as much power and influence in the new settlement and upon success they would be allowed to return home for a while and a new family would take up the slack. His family the [[House Azhdaha]] owns over 60% of the property in [[Locations/Pyre|Pyre]] so, by the town's standards, is very wealthy. He is a resident of [[Pyre]] for now until he's proved himself enough to leave.

Our family is known for it's Dragon Blood, which we optimise for, and at a young age it was clear I had the gift of the blood allowing me to use magic. This was a boon to our small family and gave us an elevation of rank. I am presently set to take over my branch of the family when my mother passes despite not being the oldest sibling. I still must prove myself worthy though in the eyes of my siblings so as to guarantee their long term loyalty.

Personality: He is not a good man for the record. He is self centered, arrogance, charming, and power-hungry. However he is smart enough to be incredibly charming (and quite attractive), like a politician, and actively hides a lot of his vile character traits. He's happy to appear selfless, and often does, if that will further his goals - looking clean is very important when conducting politics and business. That said he'd happily murder someone or betray a friend if it was safe to do so and would further his goals. Everyone is secretly a pawn to him, even his friends. The only thing that matters is family and even then it's for power.

He’d love to take over the whole family but the chance of that is low and he’d have to do a lot of amazing deeds / manipulation / betray / power plays to get there. He’s way off achieving that.

He's very smart overall, as he's had a solid education, is pretty good at dragon chess, and is very capable at all charisma skills. He's magically gifted but mostly focuses on spells which influence others and those that come from his Dragon Blood.

Appearance: 
He is a drow man who is poised and self-assured as well as possesses an elegant, almost theatrical charm. His skin is a smooth, lustrous grey-violet—a classic hallmark of drow heritage—yet it glows faintly warm in the ambient light, giving him an otherworldly allure. His sharp, angular features frame a wide, mischievous grin that hints at charm... or danger.

His hair is platinum blonde, gathered into a high, well-tied ponytail that cascades neatly down his back, suggestive of both nobility and meticulous self-care. His pointed elven ears extend gracefully from his head, subtly flaring outward, and his vivid amber-gold eyes shimmer with intelligence and delight—a flame behind them that dances between arrogance and good humour.

He’s dressed in regal crimson garments, ornate and richly textured, adorned with golden embroidery in geometric patterns. His attire includes a high-collared tunic, thick sash belts layered across his waist, and a finely tailored cloak with intricate trim—suggesting high status, perhaps once earned or cleverly assumed. He wears dark trousers and sturdy leather boots, practical enough for travel, yet fine enough to declare him no stranger to luxury.

Story so far:

[[Session 1]] - _By the hand of Xerxes Azhdaha of House Azhdaha_  
_Property-holder of Pyre, Scion of the Dragonblood, Devotee of the Night Lady_

What began as a dull merchant escort has begun to bloom into something…useful.

Our group — myself, [[Noctus Minstryxson]], [[Thavaari]], and [[Kojiki Juun]] — was tasked with reaching [[Dirthfell]] to make contact with a gnome named [[Wilbur]]. Our companions for the journey: [[Rionna]], a merchant with her eyes fixed on profit margins and little else, and [[Tolly]], a farmer whose contributions thus far are...passable. They've been travelling with us for days. I've walked grander roads, but one must occasionally plant seeds in poor soil to grow something worth harvesting.

To pass the time, we held a Dragon Chess tournament. [[Noctus Minstryxson|Noctus]] won. Predictably, he’s sharper than he lets on — clever beneath that perpetual calm. I took second, of course. [[Kojiki Juun|Koji]] came last, all impulse and poor positioning. [[Thavaari|Thavaari]], ever the blunt instrument, refused to engage at all. Tactical thinking clearly bores her.

On the third day, smoke on the horizon — a barn aflame near [[Dirthfell]]. Goblins were the cause. Mounted on boars, no less. How quaint. [[Kojiki Juun|Koji]] was the first to notice, cloaked himself in darkness and threw a punch that sent one tumbling. An effective if inelegant opening. The [[Goblin Leader|goblin leader]] charged me — presumably assuming the darkness was my doing — and missed every swing. Pathetic.

[[Thavaari|Thavaari]] unleashed her rage, and I do mean that literally. Her eyes, tattoos, and even her veins glowed green with some raw force. She struck like a berserker possessed. It was...impressive, in a feral sort of way.

I torched the [[Goblin Leader|goblin leader]] and his mount with dragonfire — the gift of my bloodline, of course — and felt the air shift. Panic. The smell of scorched fur and leather. One [[goblin dude|goblin]] fumbled from his mount trying to seize a toad from [[Rionna]]’s wagon and ended up face-first in the dirt. Another tried for [[Tolly]], but couldn't land a blow. Amateurs.

[[Noctus Minstryxson|Noctus]] finished the prone one swiftly. My owl did what it does best — flustered and scattered the rabble, offering distractions where needed. [[Kojiki Juun|Koji]] floored another and gave chase. The [[Goblin Leader|goblin leader]]  — persistent, if nothing else — continued swinging at me and continued missing. Embarrassing, really. He should’ve run.

[[Thavaari|Thavaari]] cut down another goblin with a flash of acidic light, then turned and nearly cleaved the leader in two. It was beautiful in that visceral way violence sometimes is. I scorched the rest — him, the boars — until they were on their last breaths.

Fleeing goblins were cut down: [[Thavaari|Thavaari]] sliced one boar's neck mid-gallop. [[Noctus Minstryxson|Noctus]] finished off another and tried to put an end to the leader. [[Kojiki Juun|Koji]] kept after another beast. I laid into one of the last retreating mounts — didn’t kill it, but left it burning long enough for [[Thavaari|Thavaari]] to do the honours.

And with that — combat ended.

We gathered what we could. Boar meat, hides. Six gold between the corpses — I didn’t trouble myself with the collection. Let the others pick bones. There was more valuable currency in the moment: **impressions**.

At the burning barn we found survivors — a half-orc woman named [[Helga]] and a human man, [[Kev]]. She looked tough, the kind who works with her hands and doesn’t flinch at a bit of blood. He looked like he'd never seen a day's peace in his life. I was considering what use they might be — labourers, perhaps, or connections to local networks — when [[Kojiki Juun|Koji]], ever the bleeding heart, invited them to come to [[Pyre]]. Bold of him to act without our consensus. Still, I let it stand. I even offered them a discount on housing... if they invoke my name. Influence grows faster in fertile soil.

[[Thavaari|Thavaari]] objected, naturally. She always does. Something about their barn still burning and whether they'd be a burden. Helga declined to go back for it. Smart. She’s practical. Kev said little, but followed her lead.

I floated the idea of payment. They didn't bite. [[Kojiki Juun|Koji]] undermined it immediately. No matter. Generosity, when feigned, often earns more than coin ever could. I give them my family name and offer a discount on housing if they choose to come to [[Pyre]], my family knows what to do there. If we get sent someone we know how to entrap them in debt even if the deal looks good.

Eventually we made it into [[Dirthfell]] proper. [[Rionna]] headed for the inn — _[[The Wilting Tulip]]_, of all names — and we followed. Inside, we met the bartender, [[Daryl]] — a mountain of a man, more bicep than brain. I charmed him easily. A bit of silver and a promise of strength earned us drinks in exchange for carrying barrels. I roped [[Thavaari|Thavaari]] into a two-barrel challenge — she insisted on three, naturally, and succeeded. A wonderful show. I carried two, less swiftly, but with dignity.

[[Thavaari|Thavaari]] thought I was flirting. I wasn't. She declined with a scowl, which made it all the more amusing. I enjoy watching her wrestle with social cues. Still, she seems to like me and go along with what I say which is good for the future. I'll need to be careful with her to nurture her views properly. [[Kojiki Juun|Koji]] doesn't seem to like me doing that... he doesn't seem to like me much at all. He keeps calling me a "bad man". While he's not wrong he can't go on and just SAY IT! Being called bad in front of others completely cuts off me off. It's not the end of the world though, I've brought around... or killed worse.

The night fell over a hill lit with lanterns. [[Kojiki Juun|Koji]] attempted something curious — creating tremors to help [[Noctus Minstryxson|Noctus]] “see.” I’m not sure if it worked. Didn’t matter.

A note suggested [[Wilbur]] would be delayed. Fine. That simply gives us time to entrench ourselves here. [[Noctus Minstryxson|Noctus]] spoke with the innkeeper, [[Ewald]] — older man, grey hair, military bearing. A rare sort in a town like this. He invited us to some brawl tournament. I'm up for proving myself to these farmers but [[Noctus Minstryxson|Noctus]] wanted me to not use magic against these peasants, which I think is wholly unfair! Just because they aren't born with the ability doesn't mean I should use all of myself. That said, what he doesn't notice doesn't count!
