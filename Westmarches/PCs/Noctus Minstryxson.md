Story so far:

[[Session 1]] - _By my hand, as memory requires, and duty compels._

We departed [[Pyre]] with a simple task: escort [[Rionna]], a merchant, and [[Tolly]], a farmer, to the town of **[[Dirthfell]]**, where we were to meet a gnome named [[Wilbur]] and his apprentices. It was not a noble quest by any grand measure, but it was honest work, and sometimes the honest work is where one finds the most truth.

Our party — myself, [[Thavaari]], [[Xerxes Azhdaha]], and [[Kojiki Juun]] — made good company, if a strange mix. I have come to understand them as capable, each in their own fashion.

To pass the days, [[Xerxes Azhdaha|Xerxes]] proposed a Dragon Chess tournament. I accepted. Strategy sharpens the mind as much as steel does the body. I won — cleanly. [[Xerxes Azhdaha|Xerxes]] came second; [[Kojiki Juun|Koji]]... less successful. [[Thavaari]] refused to play. I suspect the game confuses or frustrates her. She sees value in strength, not subtlety. I do not fault her.

On the third day, as we approached [[Dirthfell]], we smelled smoke. I heard the crackling — wood, dry and uncontrolled — and knew it was a structure. We soon found it: a barn ablaze. Then [[Kojiki Juun|Koji]] said the word _goblins_. He recognized them before I could. I tightened my grip on the hilt of my sword and followed.

[[Kojiki Juun|Koji]] was the first to move, shrouding himself in darkness and striking one of them with brutal precision. [[Xerxes Azhdaha|Xerxes]] was engaged almost immediately — a [[goblin leader]], I believe, mistook him as the source of the shadow and attempted to strike him down. Poorly. The creature failed repeatedly.

[[Thavaari]]’s rage flared — in her, rage is not a loss of control but a force of nature. Her tattoos lit green, her veins glowed, and she tore into them like a living storm. Her blade was relentless.

[[Xerxes Azhdaha|Xerxes]], too, displayed his gifts. His draconic lineage is no mere boast — he breathed fire, not metaphorically, but literally. I could feel the heat even through the plate. He burned goblins and boars alike.

One goblin leapt from his mount toward the wagon. I heard a thump and a squeal. It did not land well. Another rushed [[Tolly]] and missed, for which I was grateful. Another struck [[Thavaari]], and she roared back.

The one that had fallen — I finished. It was swift. I do not relish killing, but I do not hesitate when necessity calls.

The goblin leader continued to swing at [[Xerxes Azhdaha|Xerxes]], and continued to fail. [[Kojiki Juun|Koji]] darted between them, striking and then pursuing a fleeing mount. His style is... instinctual. Wild, but effective.

I recall [[Thavaari]] slashing another goblin down, and then turning to strike the leader with such force that I heard the creature gasp in something between pain and confusion.

[[Xerxes Azhdaha|Xerxes]] again bathed the battlefield in flame. Goblins and boars burned. His [[Ruh-e-Tarikhi|owl]] — a useful companion — flitted in and out, distracting where it could.

[[Thavaari]] cleaved a boar in half as it ran. I followed another and struck it down cleanly. Then I moved on the goblin leader — but missed. I do not often miss. I still think about that swing.

[[Kojiki Juun|Koji]] struck another mount. I caught up to a fleeing goblin and ended it. [[Xerxes Azhdaha|Xerxes]] blasted a boar, and [[Thavaari]] finished it. Then there was silence.

We took meat from the boars, and some fur. Someone gathered six gold from the goblins. I left it to the others.

We then came upon two survivors at the barn — a half-orc woman named [[Helga]], and a human man, [[Kev]]. She was attempting to fight the fire. He simply looked frightened.

[[Kojiki Juun|Koji]] offered them a place in [[Pyre]]. I was surprised, but not displeased. It was a generous act. [[Thavaari]] objected, initially — she is honest in a way I envy, and saw the barn as a priority. [[Helga]] told her it was lost. [[Xerxes Azhdaha|Xerxes]] offered a house discount under his name. [[Kev]] said little.

We moved on. [[Dirthfell]] awaited.

Upon arrival, [[Rionna]] directed us to the inn: _[[The Wilting Tulip]]_. It is well-kept, warm. The bartender, [[Daryl]], is a mountain of a man. I inquired about [[Wilbur]] — no sign, but [[Rionna]] found a note. He would be delayed.

I paid for a room for [[Helga]] and [[Kev]]. They had nothing. It seemed wrong to expect them to sleep in ashes.

[[Xerxes Azhdaha|Xerxes]] arranged for rooms and drink. He negotiated with [[Daryl]] — barrels for beer. He invited [[Thavaari]] to help. She carried three. I heard the strain of wood and the grunt of effort. She is far stronger than she looks.

She also spilled beer on me, testing whether the mug would make a good weapon. I said nothing. She meant no harm.

That night, we stood on a hill beneath a tree. Lanterns swayed in the breeze. [[Kojiki Juun|Koji]] tried something unusual — minor tremors, perhaps to help me see. I appreciated the gesture. I did not tell him it didn’t help. Intent matters more than outcome.

A man approached. Older. Measured steps. A soldier, or one who used to be. He introduced himself as **[[Ewald]]**, the innkeeper. He invited us to join the brawl — a contest. Tools provided. A team of four.

I accepted. [[Thavaari]] asked if the beer was the weapon. I did not correct her. I want her to be exactly who she is when we fight.
