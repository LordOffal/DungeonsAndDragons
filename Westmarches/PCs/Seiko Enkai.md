**Description**:
Seikō is a tall, graceful sea elf with a lean, muscular frame built by years at the forge. His body is dense with functional strength—broad shoulders, strong arms, and the quiet physicality of a lifelong artisan. His skin is a deep ocean-bronze, tinted with cool turquoise undertones and textured faintly with leathery scale-like markings along his jaw, shoulders, and forearms. Webbing stretches subtly between his fingers, visible when his hands are open, and his neck bears twin gill slits that pulse gently when underwater.

His hair is jet black streaked with kelp-green and midnight blue, drawn into a tight, high samurai-style topknot, with a carved pearl ornament tied into the base. A few wet strands fall free near his cheeks, like drifting seaweed. His fin-like elven ears arch back and flare outward with translucent, lionfish-like webbing, and his luminous sea-glass green eyes shimmer with layered clarity—pupils narrowing vertically in low light. They gleam with quiet intelligence and serene focus.

He wears a high-collared traveling robe in **deep indigo blue**, adorned with **traditional white wave patterns**, split at the thighs in hakama fashion. Over this, he wears a functional mantle of **seasteel chainmail**, shaped like interlocking fish scales that shimmer in hues of jade and bronze. His belt carries **tinker’s tools** in polished leather pouches, while both hands are gloved in **thick, fire-blackened smithing gloves**, reinforced at the knuckles with etched runes.

At his side—or in his hands—is his signature weapon: a long, elegant **Dai-Katana** of beautiful sea-steel, faintly glowing with Aquan runes and fitted with a thick mechanical hilt housing a **miniature steam boiler** and **release valve**. The blade vents small bursts of steam as he moves, and the metal gleams with a mix of ocean blue and heat-warped bronze, shifting like liquid mercury.

He stands barefoot on volcanic stone, posture composed, presence calm—like a still tide concealing immense depth and heat beneath the surface.

**Background:** 
Seikō Enkai was raised under the constant rhythm of hammer and tide. The son of a blacksmith and a master woodworker-weaver, his childhood was one of disciplined repetition and focused craft. His homeland, now half-submerged and fragmented by calamity, venerated crafting as sacred—a spiritual discipline rooted in honoring both flame and ocean. Seikō was trained in both iron and timber from a young age, taught to see creation as devotion. His early aptitude for magical infusion, paired with an intuitive grasp of engineering, marked him as one touched by purpose.

He left his ancestral forge to explore new materials, new ideas, and test his theories through real-world application. His creations are meant to _live_—used, tested, and refined. He seeks ancient knowledge lost to the waves, believing that recovering it might one day allow his people’s legacy to rise again from beneath the sea.

Since moving to [[Pyre]] in the initial wave he helped set up a forge as well as on the lumber yard. His versitile crafting skills has meant he has played a part in a lot of the projects [[Pyre]] created. He has a small personal workshop in his home which he uses to tinker on more magical projects such as tweaking [[Kanetama-no-Kistune Unit|Kanetama]]. Despite his skill a large number of the weapons & equipment in [[Pyre]] are not crafted by him though he does go through bursts of creation. Seiko is a believer in perfecting items so repetition is often done over and over.

Seiko spends a lot of his down time reading magical documents and books. In his desire to push his craft he knows magic and engineering will take things to the next level. From this he's gained quite the intellect though, as a man of few words, this does not often show.

**Personality**: Seikō is steady, focused, and quietly intense. He does not posture or boast; instead, he lets his work speak for him. Where others seek fame or favor, Seikō seeks _improvement_—perfection not for glory, but for truth. He treats crafting as sacred, and his demeanor reflects that calm reverence. Still, he is no ascetic; he enjoys elegance, fine detail, and the thrill of clever solutions. His discipline masks a subtle wit and understated warmth that surfaces when he trusts someone—but trust, like a blade, must be forged.

He is a patient observer, calculating before he speaks. When he does, it is with precision. He rarely raises his voice, even in battle, and his silence can be weightier than most men’s shouting. He values competence, and shows respect through shared work more than words.
