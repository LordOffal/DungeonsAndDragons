"We were riding in hot — boars snorting, blades ready — when things went real bad, real fast.

One of ‘em shrouded himself in darkness and smashed into me. Next thing I know, I’m flying backward. Someone was screaming in rage, glowing green like some jungle ghost, swinging wildly. Our leader charged, but he couldn't land a single hit — not even on a dragonborn belching fire!

I tried to grab that squishy toad thing in the wagon. Figured it’d make good loot. But I slipped like a fool and hit the dirt — next thing, I was staring up at some stabby rogue who didn’t hesitate to finish me off.

My mates tried to fight — one missed the elf girl, another did manage to hit the glowy barbarian, but most of us got burned, slashed, or scared off. I saw boars get their necks split mid-run. One of the dudes almost got away... almost. They hunted him down too. There was nowhere to hide.

Shoulda stayed home."
