After the match Thavaari picks up her items and well follow her lead and party. Xerxes whispers sweet nothings into Thavaari's ear and tries to make friends with her. Thavaari and Noctus have a friendly duel where Thavaari loses handedly. Noctus wins bout 1 and 2 (with Thavaari starting to rage from round 2 onwards). Noctus tells her to control her rage but she then attacks quickly from behind to win round 3. Thavaari celebrates her "victory" (even if it's a loss) and Xerxes makes it grander by making some minor lights appear.

Koji wanders the village looking for ne'er-do-wells. One person from the "The Village Idiots" talks to Koji and telling him how impressive he is. Koji tells him he can teach him if he comes to Pyre (his training school is there). The man isn't convinced the town is doing well based on Koji's clothing but seems interested in the training.

We all go to bed. Thavaari and I go to our seperate rooms. Noctus and Koji sleep outside. We sleep well and all have breakfast in the morning. The others help around town but Xerxes talks to the mayor again and apologises for the night before (making him feel like I was taking advantage of him) and if he needs investment he knows who to reach out to. He quickly rushes off.

Two people turn up who look scholarly people turn up (two humans) and we are told these might be our people. Both in worn finery, one male and one female. Non-descript; the girl has alburn hair and freckly and the man has short black hair and blue eyes. Petrum and Josta. Daryl says "These people are from Pyre.". They ask if we were there to see them. Noctus asks if where Wilbur is but they relay he's been taken by goblins. Noctus organises them to be taken care of and get's directions. Thavaari wolfs down her food and Koji takes any non perishables in his bag.

We are told that they might be near the abandoned mines so we should head there. We see some signs of people on the route (some fabric). After time we find a sign of an attack which would have been where they attacked the group. The route clearly has a road to the mountains which makes it easy to follow.

Eventually we get to some hill leading to a cliff side. We see some people had dug into the rock which has a fence around it and tents on the inside. We decide to stealth in. Koji tries to move between bushes and seems to succeed, Thavaari seems to move weirdly steathily, however Noctus and Xerxes seems to not be stealthing well. Koji hears arguing in goblin and makes a distraction minor illusion. Koji quickly peers over the fence and sees a lot of goblins and a hobgoblin. Xerxes walks towards the hoboblin leader to talk to him. At that point Noctus tries to jump the fence and causes a crashing noise. Thavaari just leaps over. Combat starts!

Xerxes casts suggestion on the hobgoblin saying "Tell me where your treasure is, shout ‘Flee!’, sprint into the mine, mine gold for six hours—ignoring all but my commands. Then surrender.” but it fails. Koji then hides in the tent waiting to jump out when the enemies charge forward. Thavaari charges towards the shaman goblin, trampling over a small tent, and swings recklessly. The shaman quickly reacts raising her staff and casting a spell causing Thavaari to miss. The Hobgoblin shouts something in goblin then runs into a tent, disappearing and appearing out another with a torch. He then throws a dart at Thavaari which misses.

The shaman swings her staff at Thavaari and misses comfortably (she swears in goblin) then follows up with another swing which does hit causes 14 points of psychic damage. Noctus charges the shaman and hits clearly and she looks quite bloodied now.

The other goblins run to the cave. Koji moves in the shadows to the otherside. Xerxes then tries suggestion again on the hobgoblin which works! Making him “Say where your treasure is—in Common, shout ‘Flee!’, sprint into the mine, mine gold for six hours, ignoring all but my questions. Then surrender." The hobgoblin then complies by telling Xerxes the treasure is the life style. Koji then murders a goblin with some amazing punches then darts into the tent. Then Thavaari recklessly attacks the shaman rapidly. It's so furious and fast! Her messy hit slashes across the Shaman's body, mangling it. The shaman tried to raise her staff but just couldn't do it in time. Noctus runs to the last goblin and stabs his sword straight through it causing the goblin to look around sword through it's chest as it dies.

After that we cut the fuse for the TnT near the entrance saving the day.

Combat ended

We all sprint in the mine. Xerxes shouts "Leave him he's under my spell and is harmless for now." The passage is about 5-10ft wide as we run in. Xerxes is a bit behind the rest and Koji is a bit a head due to his speed. Eventually we come to a dead end with 2 goblins, the hobgoblin, and some prisoners. Koji then casts darkness on himself which gives the effect that the darkness closes in. The 2 goblins look covered in black skin and barely look alive. Wilbur is holding a book and says "The charged god will save us.". Koji moves right up to one. The other moves over to the hobgoblin and tries to talk to him in a crackling language. Another runs forward out of the darkness.

Combat starts

Koji runs over to one guy in the darkness and hits him perfectly but misses with his follow up attack. He then uses his ki and punches one more time pushing the guy away a bit. Then Koji moves to a different part of the darkness. One of the drained goblins charges forward at Thavaari swinging a fiery scimitar at her and misses. The other charges away from the hobgoblin toward Thavaari. 

Xerxes casts a lightning orb on at one which cleanly hits it and tries to bounce to the next goblin but it misses the bounce. On death the hit goblin explodes in fire hitting us all (bar Koji) in flames. Thavaari then slashes and shoves the other one killing it and making it explode away from the group.

--Went to the loo--

Came back and it was the captains go who attacked the prisoners near by but missed. Koji moves over to the captain and hits him perfectly but then misses his flurry of punches after - hitting the dark air around him. The remaining basic goblin attacks koji but misses.

Noctus swings at the snake one with a super powerful sword attack hits and hurts it badly but does not kill it. 

We beat them.

Combats over. Koji and Noctus walk over to free the guy
