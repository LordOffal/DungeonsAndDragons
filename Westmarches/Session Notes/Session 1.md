We, the part of [[Xerxes Azhdaha]], [[Noctus Minstryxson]], [[Thavaari]], & [[Kojiki Juun]]; have been put on task to meet up in the town of [[Dirthfell]] a Gnome and his apprentices called [[Wilbur]]. To travel there we are escorting [[Rionna]] (a merchant) and [[Tolly]] (a farmer) who will go to sell their wears. [[Noctus Minstryxson]] is, very much in the lightest sense, the leader of our lose group. The journey will take a few days and on the way [[Xerxes Azhdaha]], [[Noctus Minstryxson]], & [[Kojiki Juun]] play a mini-tournament of Dragon Chess to which [[Noctus Minstryxson]] wins quite comfortably, [[Xerxes Azhdaha]] comes second, and [[Kojiki Juun]] comes third. [[Thavaari]] shows no interest in this at all and actively avoids people playing Dragon Chess.

As we are traveling, on the 3rd day we see a barn on fire as we get near the town of [[Dirthfell]].

- [[Kojiki Juun]] works out that they are goblins, likely riding on something. (Turns out boars)
- [[Kojiki Juun]] readied Darkness on himself and charged in and punched the [[Goblin dude]] with a punch which pushed him away.
- [[Goblin Leader]] charges me thinking I was in control of the darkness and misses consistently
- [[Thavaari]] starts to rage, her eyes glow green, her tattoos start glowing green, and her veins start glowing green. She recklessly attacks the [[Goblin Leader]]
- [[Xerxes Azhdaha]] uses Dragon Breath and blows fire at [[Goblin Leader]] and his mount but the mount manages to mitigate some damage.
- One [[Goblin dude]] goes to the wagon, jumps off of his boar mount and tries to wrangle a toad but fails so badly he lands on the ground prone.
- Another [[Goblin dude]] attacks [[Tolly]] but misses.
- Another [[Goblin dude]] attacks [[Thavaari]] and hits her hard
- [[Xerxes Azhdaha]] owl flys in to help then away
- [[Noctus Minstryxson]] stabs the [[Goblin dude]] who fell prone to death.
- [[Kojiki Juun]] decks a dude and chases a boar
- [[Goblin Leader]] swings at [[Xerxes Azhdaha]] more and continues to miss.
- [[Thavaari]] goes for the [[Goblin dude]] who [[Xerxes Azhdaha]]'s owl fluttered infront of. An acidic green flash slashes through the goblin. She then swings at the [[Goblin Leader]] and critical hits the dude almost killing him.
- [[Xerxes Azhdaha]] burns the boars infront of him and the [[Goblin Leader]] to near death
- [[Xerxes Azhdaha]]'s owl flies in to haras a boar then flies away
- The boar tries to run and [[Thavaari]] slashes through it as it runs, cutting through it's neck
- [[Noctus Minstryxson]] slashes another down as it tries to run, then charges the [[Goblin Leader]] and fails to hit him
- [[Kojiki Juun]] attacks the running boar who got away and pummels
- [[Noctus Minstryxson]] kills the fleeting [[Goblin dude]] and [[Xerxes Azhdaha]] attacks his fleeing boar which hurts it but doesn't kills it.
- [[Thavaari]] kills the boar right after.
Combat ends.

We harvested the boars for meat and fur.
Found 6 gold on their bodies in total (Not added to sheets)

We go over to the burning barn which is quite small. It's engulfed in flames. We see a half-orc with a human. The half-orc is a woman who clearly tried to put the flames out.

[[Kojiki Juun]] talks to them and offers for them to come with us to Pyre. The Half-Orc lady seems interested and her human partner seems to agree (though is clearly nervous since all the humans died in their home town). Half-Orc lady is a herbalist and is called [[Helga]]; and the man is called [[Kev]].

[[Thavaari]], interjects their barn is on fire and they should oput it out. [[Helga]], says there is no point since it's gone out of control. [[Thavaari]] doesn't want them to join us but [[Kojiki Juun]] insists they can come. [[Xerxes Azhdaha]] says they can get a good discount on a home if they come to Pyre and say my name. [[Helga]] tells us the goblins stole the hogs from Father John. [[Kojiki Juun]] asks if they have any carts or anything but it's a no. [[Xerxes Azhdaha]] tries to get some payment out of [[Helga]] and [[Kev]] but [[Kojiki Juun]] insists it will be free; despite [[Xerxes Azhdaha]]'s smooshing.

Introductions happen from the group to [[Helga]] and [[Kev]]. We head to [[Dirthfell]] where we intend to sell our wares and pick up [[Wilbur]] and his 2 assistants. It's a small 

[[Rionna]] wants to visit the inn. [[Noctus Minstryxson]], [[Xerxes Azhdaha]], [[Thavaari]] head into the inn with here. The inn is called [[The Wilting Tulip]]; the bartender is a very large bloke. [[Noctus Minstryxson]] asks him if he's seen a [[Wilbur]]. [[Rionna]] sees a slip of paper that [[Wilbur]] might be a day late. The bartender mentions there is a farmer's festival and [[Noctus Minstryxson]] asks for details. It's a festival celebrating the harvest. [[Noctus Minstryxson]] pays for a room (for [[Helga]] & [[Kev]]).

[[Noctus Minstryxson]] takes care of the toads for the night; then beds down for the night in the cart. [[Kojiki Juun]] is sleeping by the cart.

[[Xerxes Azhdaha]] buys [[Thavaari]] and himself a room. [[Xerxes Azhdaha]] pays for the room and negotiates us a free drink. The bartender says if we can carry a barrel down each to get a free beer. [[Xerxes Azhdaha]] smooshes [[Thavaari]] to be a team (which is a very humous conversation because of how innocent she is and how slimy Xerxes is) and convinces her to attempt to carry 2 barrels. [[Thavaari]] tries 3 barrels and does carry . [[Xerxes Azhdaha]] carries 2 as well but it takes him some time. [[Thavaari]] thinks [[Xerxes Azhdaha]] is flirting with her and she rejects him (he was not, he was just trying to be charming and manipulative).

Night has fully fallen now. A grassy hill, with a single tree on the knoll. It's a beautifully starry night. Lanterns are everywhere. [[Kojiki Juun]] tries to make it more accessible for the blind [[Noctus Minstryxson]] by trying to create some tremors for him to see. The event is a community thing, an a slightly nicer name appears. He talks to some of the farmers and comes to talk to us. He is the innkeeper. The bartender's name is Daryl. The innkeeper is an older human man, grey hair, and looks composed (military bearing). We ask if he's met [[Wilbur]]. Innkeeper's name is [[Ewald]]. 

[[Ewald]] invites us into our brawl competition as a team of 4. [[Thavaari]] tries to work out how to use the mugs of beer as a weapon which leads her to think that the beer itself is a weapon and spilling it on [[Noctus Minstryxson]]. We are told that there will be tools on the field to use.
