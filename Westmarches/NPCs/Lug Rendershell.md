**Physical description (including clothing):**  
Lug is a towering figure, standing at least 6 feet tall with broad shoulders and a muscular build that reflects his role as a guard. His greenish skin, marked with faint tribal tattoos, contrasts sharply with his dark, coarse hair, which he keeps tied back in a simple ponytail. His tusks, though slightly dulled, still protrude from his lower jaw, giving him a fierce appearance. His eyes are a deep brown, sharp and alert, always watching his surroundings. Lug wears a mix of hardened leather armor and rough, patchwork clothing. His chest is adorned with a simple leather tunic, and his legs are covered in thick, durable trousers. A worn belt with a pouch for basic supplies holds his gear together. He carries a large, heavy axe strapped to his back, ready to swing at a momentâ€™s notice.
