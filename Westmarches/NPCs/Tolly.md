Lean and weather-worn from years of working the land. Likely dresses in simple, practical earth-toned clothes suited for travel and labor. Carries a walking stick and has a quiet, unassuming presence.

Story so far:

Session 0 - Tolly has been walking the cart with the group on our merchants trip for days so far.

[[Session 1]] - _“I grow things. I don’t kill them.”_

That had been my quiet mantra since joining this merchant trip. I’d been walking alongside the cart for days, minding my own business, watching the trees sway and thinking about irrigation techniques. The others — gods help me — were clearly built for trouble. Still, I figured I’d be safe among them.

Then came the goblins.

Boars came thundering through the underbrush, and suddenly all my walking turned to dodging. [[Kojiki Juun]] charged into the darkness and knocked one senseless. [[Thavaar]] — stars above — went green-glow berserk and hacked into their leader like a storm given form. Xerxes just breathed fire like that was a perfectly normal thing to do before breakfast.

One of the little [[Goblin dude|goblin bastards]] lunged at me. Missed, thank the trees. Maybe he thought I looked like easy prey — a harmless elf in farmer’s clothes. Joke’s on him: I _am_ easy prey. I just happened to be travelling with lunatics.

I saw one [[Goblin dude|goblin]] trip while leaping from a boar, flopping like a sack of beets. He didn’t get up. Another ran. Didn’t get far. They were picked off like crows in a field.

I clutched my walking stick the whole time — never swung it once.

When it was all over, I just stared at the carnage.

_“I used to worry about blight,”_ I muttered to no one. _“Now I worry about the gods setting my escort on fire.”_

We entered [[Dirthfell]]. I stood awkwardly while the others booked rooms and flirted over barrels. I didn't even understand what was happening. I’m just hoping this [[Wilbur]] chap shows up and no one asks me to punch anything.
