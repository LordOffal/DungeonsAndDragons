Story so far:

[[Session 1]] - _"Every festival someone tries to flirt, fight, or fly. These folks might do all three."_

New faces — never good news, but good for business. The Tabaxi looked smart. The barbarian looked lost. The drow looked like trouble. And that blind guy? Looked like he could stab me before I blinked.

They came in asking about [[Wilbur]]. Said they were here for him. Shame he’s late — again.

One of them — the drow smooth-talker — asked about a free drink. Told him he’d have to earn it. Carry barrels. He took it well. Even convinced the green-eyed one to help. Girl tried lifting _three_. Madness.

They’re strong. Dangerous. But something about them made the inn feel alive again. And that’s worth the noise.

Told ‘em about the brawl. [[Ewald]]’s idea. Gods help whoever ends up across from the glowy one.
