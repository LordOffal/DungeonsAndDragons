!! AI extrapolated from here !!
Wears neat clothes befitting a respectable innkeeper — crisp vest, rolled sleeves. Hosts local events like the brawl competition and seems to command quiet respect from the townsfolk.

Story so far:

[[Session 1]] - _"I’ve seen mercenaries come and go. These ones… might just be heroes. Or disasters."_

The moment I saw them, I knew. Fighters. Survivors. Not your average traveling troupe. Still, they were respectful. Asked after [[Wilbur]]. Didn’t push. Offered coin. One paid for the refugees’ room without a second thought. That meant something.

The festival’s tomorrow. Spirits are high. We need distractions from bad harvests and goblin rumors. So I offered them a spot in the brawl. Tools on the field. No real weapons. Let’s see if they’ve got more than fire and flash.

They seem game. That [[Thavaar|Thavaar]] girl thinks the beer _is_ the weapon. She might not be wrong.

I’ll be watching. Closely.
