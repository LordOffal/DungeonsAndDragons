**Physical description (including clothing):**  
A young, sprightly halfling with curly, chestnut brown hair that bounces as she moves, and bright, curious eyes that shine with the energy of youth. Her round face is freckled, with a wide, warm smile that contrasts with the darkness of the underground. Tera is shorter than most, standing just under 3 feet tall, with a wiry, yet strong frame from years of running and climbing in tight spaces. She wears a patchwork outfit that’s a little too big for her, consisting of sturdy leather pants, a simple vest, and a green cloak she’s clearly outgrown. Around her waist, she has a small belt with a few pouches for tools or snacks. She’s clearly more at ease in the rough conditions of the cave than the adults around her, though she still seems unsure of the dangers lurking beneath.
