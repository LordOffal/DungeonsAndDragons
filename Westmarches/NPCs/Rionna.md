Feline features with sleek fur, agile build, and sharp, observant eyes. Likely adorned in layered traveling garb with storage pouches and merchant sashes — practical but with a touch of flair. She drives the cart and keeps her distance from violence, always looking for business opportunity.

Story so far:

Session 0 - Rionna has been driving the cart with the group on our merchants trip for days so far.

[[Session 1]] - _“All I wanted was a smooth road, a few good deals, and perhaps a story to bring back to the market.”_

The journey had been... tolerable. The road was clear, the coin promised decent, and while my travelling companions weren’t exactly the refined sort, they kept to themselves—mostly. I kept the cart steady, eyes ahead, claws lightly tapping the reins in rhythm.

Then, on the third day, smoke. A barn ablaze. And before I could blink, howls and hooves. Goblins — riding boars, no less. One made a wild attempt to wrangle a toad from my cart. He fell flat on his face. I didn’t even twitch.

Chaos erupted. [[Kojiki Juun|Kojiki]] disappeared into magical darkness and threw fists like war drums. [[Thavaar|Thavaar]] turned into some glowing, green-eyed fury. [[Xerxes Azhdaha|Xerxes]] — I _think_ that one breathes fire — set half the road alight. And [[Noctus Minstryxson|Noctus]], ever silent, skewered one cleanly.

I stayed seated. Not out of cowardice, mind you — out of _prudence_. Merchants live by risk assessment.

When it ended, the ground was littered with dead boars, bruised [[Goblin dude|goblins]], and bits of smoke curling off charred leaves.

We found two survivors — a half-orc woman, [[Helga]], and a man clinging close behind her. Kojiki vouched for them. [[Thavaar|Thavaar]] seemed wary. [[Xerxes Azhdaha|Xerxes]] seemed like he was trying to sell something.

Eventually, we reached [[Dirthfell]]. It was... charming, in a rural, underdeveloped sort of way. I made straight for the inn — _The Wilting Tulip_. Rustic. Functional. More importantly, it had wine.

I overheard talk of a harvest festival, and a slip of parchment saying [[Wilbur]] — our supposed contact — might be delayed. Of course.

I asked for a room, but the group had already arranged it. That [[Noctus Minstryxson|Noctus]] fellow has a surprising knack for logistics. Perhaps he ran a caravan once.

For now, I intend to sleep on a mattress that doesn’t creak like a dying mule. Whatever nonsense the rest of them get into next? I’ll be at the bar. Watching. Quietly.
