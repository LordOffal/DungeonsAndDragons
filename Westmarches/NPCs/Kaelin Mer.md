**Physical description (including clothing):**  
A middle-aged man with an appearance that speaks of years spent in the harsh underground tunnels. His skin is weathered, with a tanned complexion from constant exposure to the dim light of the mines. Kaelin's face is sharp and solemn, with crow's feet around his dark, tired eyes. His hair, a mixture of salt and pepper, is unkempt but kept short for practicality. His muscular frame, honed by years of hard labor, is clad in simple, utilitarian mining clothesâ€”worn leather boots, a tattered tunic, and a sturdy belt adorned with a few mining tools. A rough, weathered cloak hangs loosely over his shoulders, its fabric fraying at the edges. His demeanor is calm, but his posture speaks of vigilance, as though he is always prepared for what the dark tunnels might throw at him.
