**Physical description (including clothing):**  
Mags is a small and spry gnome, standing at just under 4 feet tall, with a wiry build and hands that are quick and nimble. Her dark green eyes twinkle with intelligence, and her face is often framed by a few strands of curly, dark brown hair that she constantly tucks behind her ears. A few faint stains of alchemical mixtures dot her skin, the signs of a life spent in labs and workshops. Mags wears a practical, patched tunic that’s tailored to her small frame, with a series of pouches and vials hanging from her belt, each filled with ingredients, tools, or potions for her alchemical work. Over her tunic, she wears a leather apron, its edges covered in soot and various stains. A set of goggles rests on her head, always ready for use when she’s in her element.
