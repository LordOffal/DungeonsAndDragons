Story So Far:

[[Session 1]] - _"First fire. Then strangers. And now... another road."_

The barn burned too fast to stop it. I tried. My arms still ache from the buckets. Everything we had — gone. My herbs, tools, shelter. Gone.

And then these people showed up. A strange crew: glowing barbarians, fire-breathing warriors, one in literal magical darkness. Yet it was [[Kojiki Juun|Kojiki]] — quiet, respectful — who offered help.

[[Thavaar|Thavaar]] didn’t want us coming. I get it. She sees risk. She isn’t wrong. But [[Kojiki Juun|Kojiki]] insisted. And [[Xerxes Azhdaha|Xerxes]]… tried to get us to _pay_. I grow _lavender_, not coin. That said [[Xerxes Azhdaha|Xerxes]] did say we could quote his name for a cheap home in [[Pyre]].

Still, [[Pyre]] sounded safe. A home. Better than ash and rot. [[Kev]] seemed shaken, but he trusts me. He followed.

[[Dirthfell]] was quiet. Lanterns. Festival preparations. A tavern with a strange name and heavy-handed charm. I kept to the side, watching how they moved. They’re dangerous. Kind, perhaps. But dangerous.

And we’re staying in the inn now. Thanks to [[Noctus Minstryxson|Noctus]]. I watched [[Thavaar|Thavaar]] lift barrels like twigs and [[Xerxes Azhdaha|Xerxes]] smirk his way to free ale. These people burn bright. Maybe too bright.

But for now? They offered shelter. And that’s enough.
