**Physical description (including clothing):**  
Elowen is a striking Tiefling, with violet skin that glows faintly in the dark and curling, dark horns that sweep back from her forehead. Her long, dark hair is streaked with purple, and it falls in loose waves around her shoulders. Her eyes are a bright amber, full of curiosity and a hint of mischief. Despite her somewhat delicate appearance, Elowen has a lean, athletic build, with a graceful stride that suggests years of travel. She wears a simple but functional outfitâ€”a fitted tunic and trousers in deep hues of purple and black, with a satchel slung over her shoulder that contains her mapping tools. A rope coil is fastened at her waist, and a pair of sturdy boots help her navigate the underground terrain with ease. Her attire is practical but with subtle details that give it a touch of elegance, like silver clasps on her tunic and an ornate pin holding her cloak in place.
