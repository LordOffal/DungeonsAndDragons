Story so far:

[[Session 1]] - _"Don’t panic. Just breathe. Let Helga speak."_

The fire took everything. Our neighbours. Friends. The animals. It was like the whole world exploded into heat and screaming.

Then they arrived. These adventurers. Gods, they were terrifying. One glowed green and chopped through goblins like firewood. Another breathed actual fire. One stabbed a [[Goblin dude|goblin]] so fast I didn’t see him move.

[[Helga]] talked to them. I just stood behind her. I didn’t know what to say. I didn’t want to follow anyone. But what else was left? [[Pyre]] sounded far. Safer. Maybe.

The woman [[Thavaar|Thavaar]] didn’t want us. The one with fire in her eyes. She scared me the most. But [[Kojiki Juun|Kojiki]] said we could come. And the charming drow tried to haggle. We had nothing. [[Kojiki Juun|Kojiki]] won that argument.

In [[Dirthfell]], everything felt normal again. Warm light. Laughter. Ale.

But they’re entering a _brawl competition_. With tools. I am never going near the ring. I’ll stay by the fire. Maybe help the innkeeper clean up. Maybe just breathe.
