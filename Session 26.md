The dragon lands on the top of the deck. We scramble to think what to do, Haliloo tries to convince the dragon to not kill us but she roars at him. Haliloo realises she's blind. Valdric casts Fly on Ted and Deion. Sudo and Valdric jump in the bag of holding. Deion then flies up trying to stealth passed the dragon. As he's flying passed the man on the back looks like a corpse (he's very much dead).

The dragon does cold breath which instantly downs Ted and Haliloo, and nstantly killing the panther and Reggie. Deion takes a glancing blow but is fine. Deion flies off leaving Ted and Haliloo behind but sees some humanoid running at speed into the ship. Deion keeps flying away. The Kobolds loot Ted and Haliloo)

The humanoid casts fog in the ship, grabs Haliloo and Ted, then casts silence and runs out. The dragon notices some treasure is gone and damages the ship. Deion watches this happen then flies down to the, what he realises, is a woman and checks in on Ted and Haliloo. She has a very serious face. The Dragon roars! 

Deion let's Valdric and Sudo out the bag. The lady tries to save Haliloo but he's already dead. Sudo revives Ted and Deion tell him to resurect Deion. Ted goes to find his diamond but doesn't find the diamond. Haliloo dies forever....

Tinjong is the lady who tells us that lots of people die near the ship and tells us off. We rest and preserve the body in ice. She tells us to follow the coast east to find a whale who might help us. She gives us 12g each. She gives Ted a book, leather bound, very small. It was found off the ship. Ted opens it and inside of it mostly empty but the pages that are filled are star charts plus hand drawn diagrams of the journey the ship took. It shows 3 locations one near us and two others which might be entrances to Netheril. We decide we should go to the nearest one.

We have a long rest. 

While asleep Valdric is visited by his patron godess who seems upset as he asked for her help by praying for Haliloo. She's disapointed in him, while cuddling up to him in a seductive manner, as he's not been giving her enough tributes. 

Ted while asleep sees a vision of his homeland but it isn't. Its a field. Each blink looks different to my homeland, moving further away. It gradually changes into what looks to be verdant grass. Ted has this really nice feeling in his chest. The clouds part away from the sun. The sun seems to get bigger, brighter, and warmer. Ted hears a single word, it's a deep voice coming from no where (coming from the wind almost) with a feeling of warmth and trust, "Thank you". When Ted wakes up his shield looks almost like it's glowing (not candle like) but it looks greater for a split second. When I look at Sudo some of his branches and wood grain have shapped themselves to look like Amaunator's holy symbol.

Ted learns in the long rest that the pouch is a grey bag of tricks.
